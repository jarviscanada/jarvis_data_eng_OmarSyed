Implemented 5 different classification methods, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm), Decision Tree Classification, and ANN (Artificial Neural Network), by using the Scikit-Learn to render a model that can predict with high accuracy whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. Accuracy was measured with a portion of the dataset being used for testing to compare the performance of the classification methods.",

  "summary": "I graduated from Ryerson University with a Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree in Computer Science and a minor in Finance. During this time, I gathered project experience with a large variety of software tools and programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Prolog, MATLAB, and much more. In university, I specialized in Data Engineering with courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Database Systems, Probability and Statistics and Data Mining. With a vast amount of experience in group projects, I learned how to effectively collaborate and efficiently lead my team to desired goals. I joined Jarvis Consulting in July of 2022, where I worked on projects revolving around key concepts such as Computer Networks, Dockers and containers, Linux bash scripting, PostgreSQL, DDL, Python Data Analytics, Pandas/Numpy, Data Warehouse, Hadoop, and more. Along with extensive technical experience, Jarvis also provided me with experience working under an Agile framework. The software and data industries excite me most for one simple reason, the extent of their reach and effect on our real and virtual world."
