Implemented 5 different classification methods, Gussian Naive Bayes Classification, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, Decision Tree Classification and ANN(Artifical Neural Networ), by using the Scikit-Learn to render a model that can predict with high accuracy whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. Accuracy was measured with a portion of the dataset being used for testing in order to compare the preformance of the classicaition methods.",

  "summary": "I, Omar Syed, graduated from Ryerson University with a Bachelor's of Science (Honors) degree in Computer Science and a minor in Finance. During this time, I gathered project experience with a large varity of software tools and programming languages such as, Python, Java, PHP, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Prolog, MATLAB and much more. In university, I focused my last two year course load towards Data related courses, most noteable being, Data Structures, Algorithms, Database Systems, Probability and Statistics and Data Mining. With a vast amount of experience in group projects, I leanred how to effectively collaborate and efficiently lead my team to the desired goals. I joined Jarvis Consulting in July, two weeks after graduation. At Jarvis I worked on projects providing me with experience and a strong understanding of the related topics, such as Computer Networks, Dockers and containers, Linux bash scripting, PostgreSQL, DDL, Python Data Analytics, Pandas/Numpy, Data Warehouse and more. Along with extensive technical experience, Jarvis also provided me with experience working under an Agile framework, helping me to better work as a team. The software and data industries excite me most for one simple reason, the extent of its reach and effect on our real and virtual world. The possibilities are endless and so are the oppertunities."
